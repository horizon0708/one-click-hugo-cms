# About

An emerging artist based in Wellington, New Zealand. I am passionate about Illustration and Animation, as well as
Painting and Design. 

Inspired by culture and nature, these elements are often expressed through my art. I aim to
develop my work by exploring a range of mediums and techniques to apply in upcoming projects. 

I am an
active member of the Wellington Zine Community and the Lemon Eye Artist Collective. Currently available for
freelance opportunities, please enquire by [email](mailto:treesneal@gmail.com)
