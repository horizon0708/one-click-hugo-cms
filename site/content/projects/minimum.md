title: Minimum
type: Animation
description: "[Minimum](loadingdocs.net/minimum) is a short documentary web-series depicting women’s minimum-wage
employment experiences, combining animation with interviews. This series was funded by NZ On Air as part of the
125
th anniversary of Women's Suffrage in New Zealand.
As animator I worked from initial storyboarding to finalized animation sequences, maintaining a consistent tone
and style appropriate to the series. This series has been highly received online across Radio New Zealand’s social
media accounts and has also been screened at Parliament.
