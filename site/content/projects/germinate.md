description: >-
  Germinate was an exhibition arranged by the Lemon Eye Artist Collective,
  including five works by myself. As a group of emerging artists, our first
  exhibition reflected this through exploring themes of growing and developing
  through nature motifs. My works interpret Germinate through exploring the
  seasonal progression of flora immersed in our daily surroundings. 


  Acrylic and Watercolour on Wood, August 2018. $180 each
