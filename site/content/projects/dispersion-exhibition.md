type: Exhibition
description: >-
  Displayed at the New Zealand Parliament Bowen House Exhibition Space April -
  May 2019 as part of the Lemon Eye Artist Collective. Reminisce, Retrospect and
  Retain explore the theme of Dispersion through the deconstruction of
  traditional cel animation. Thick transparent acrylic is used to separate the
  layers of each piece and create an exaggerated dispersed effect. This warped
  depth plays with perceived notions of alignment, movement and perspective.
  Each piece embodies a feeling associated with memory, visualized as a girl
  living through past experiences.


  Gouache and marker pen on Acrylic, 2019. $200 each
