  Reminisce, Retrospect and Retain explore the theme of Dispersion through the
  deconstruction of traditional cel animation. Thick transparent acrylic is used
  to separate the layers of each piece and create an exaggerated dispersed
  effect. This warped depth plays with perceived notions of alignment, movement
  and perspective. Each piece embodies a feeling associated with memory,
  visualized as a girl living through past experiences.
